# node-red-contact-form-examples #

contact and user feedback flows for Node-RED


*(currently under active development, please stay tuned - to be finished by end of October)*


> Just a small note: if you like this work and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.

## Prerequisites ##

Both examples require the following Node-RED extension

* [node-red-contrib-reusable-flows](https://github.com/rozek/node-red-contrib-reusable-flows)<br>"Reusable Flows" allow multiply needed flows to be defined once and then invoked from multiple places
* [node-red-node-email](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes/tree/master/social/email)<br>contains Node-RED nodes to send and receive simple emails
